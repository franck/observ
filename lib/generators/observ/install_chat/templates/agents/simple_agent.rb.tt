# SimpleAgent - A basic agent example
#
# This agent demonstrates the minimum required implementation
# for a working agent in the Observ chat UI.
#
# To create your own agent:
# 1. Extend BaseAgent
# 2. Include AgentSelectable to make it appear in the UI
# 3. Implement required methods: system_prompt, default_model, display_name
# 4. Optionally add tools and initial_greeting
class SimpleAgent < BaseAgent
  include AgentSelectable

  # Display name shown in the Observ UI
  def self.display_name
    "Simple Agent"
  end

  # Description shown in agent selection
  def self.description
    "A basic conversational agent"
  end

  # System prompt that defines the agent's behavior
  def self.system_prompt
    <<~PROMPT
