# ThinkTool - A basic tool for agent reflection
#
# This tool allows agents to "think out loud" and reflect on their
# reasoning process. Useful for debugging and understanding agent behavior.
#
# To create your own tools:
# 1. Extend RubyLLM::Tool
# 2. Add description and params
# 3. Implement execute method
# 4. Add tool to agent's tools array
